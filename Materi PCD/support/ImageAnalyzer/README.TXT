Description:
------------
  Advanced image editing, enhancement and analysis software.


Some of the features:
---------------------
   Read/write BMP, ICO, CUR, WMF, EMF, JPEG, PNG, GIF, PCX and JPEG 2000 files
   Read RAS, PNM, PGM, PPM, HIPS and Matlab files
   Scanner and printer support
   Build-in conventional and adaptive filters
   User specified filters in spatial and frequency domain
   Distance, Fourier and discrete cosine transformation
   Restoration by (blind) deconvolution
   Color model conversion: RGB, CMY, HSI, Lab, PCA, YCbCr and YIQ
   Easy red-eye removal
   Morphological operations
   Resize, rotate, crop and warping
   Math expression module for creating and transforming images
   Advanced "pocket" calculator with equation solver
   Plugin system for image processing and extended file format support


Short description of MAP file format:
-------------------------------------
  File header:
    MAP           : 3 bytes     The characters 'MAP'
    Version       : DWord       1
    PixelFormat   : DWord       $01  : Byte data
                                $02  : Word data
                                $40  : Single floating point data (32 bit)
                                $80  : Double floating point data (64 bit)
    Width, Height : DWord       Image size
    Planes        : Byte        1    : Real values
                                2    : Complex values (real,imaginary)
    Compression   : Byte        0    : None, raw data
                                1    : Deflate compressed (default)
                                2    : Another variant of LZ77

  Following is the data compressed as specified by the Compression parameter.
  For complex data the real plane is stored first and then the complex plane.
  The data is stored line by line, left to right from top to bottom.
  The present version of Image Analyzer always uses the deflate compression
  for writing files. Description of the Deflate standard can be found at
  http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib_docs.html
